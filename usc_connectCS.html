    <p class="small__headings">PROBLEM</p>
    <h2 class="big__headings problem__heading">The University fails to connect with their students</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">A series of concerts, events, important information ( e.g. the date of the restart of the semester) and the inability of sourcing important documents easily causes a disconnect between the University and their students. This sparks the question - “How can we connect the University staff to their students?”</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="small__headings">The Solution</p>
    <h2 class="big__headings solution_heading">A centralized media platform is key</h2>

    <p class="small__headings">QUALITATIVE RESEARCH </p>
    <h2 class="big__headings research_heading">A way to connect the university with 90% of their students…</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">Starting with a survey, we explored where students got disconnected with the University. When we got an eye-opening response from a student.</p>
    <h5 class="quote">"...  Almost all the time. You ask one faculty they send you to another then another for about a good few times before you finally reach the right person. Sometimes the forms are not offered at its usual spot."</h5>

    <p class="small__headings">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS + THE DIFFERENCE </p>
    <h2 class="big__headings competition_heading">The competition had to much NAVIGATION and DISTRACTING CONTENT</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">While keeping the above quote in mind, we analyzed the three most popular ways to get news about event etc. and important resources. I found that almost all of them enervate their user in different ways. This because  our oppunitity for a solution.</p>

    <p class="small__headings">USER INTERVIEWS</p>
    <h2 class="big__headings competition_heading">Our Interviewees were 3x more likely to not miss an important event when there were simple data in one place. Decreasing their searching time.</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">We conducted interviews with 8 students who from different departments, age groups and genders. We have asked them the questions below to find thrends on how they were disconnected from the school then organized my data through affinity mapping.</p>
    <p class="regular__textbox research__questions">RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="questions">How do you get information about events, activities and concerts from the University of the Southern Caribbean? </li>
        <li class="questions">How often would you check for events around the campus and online? When did you last check those platforms?</li>
        <li class="questions">Where would you rather get your news about events from USC and why?</li>
        <li class="questions">Have you ever missed an important event from USC because you did not know about the event or date?Can you elaborate?</li>
        <li class="questions">How would you rate the accessibility of the resources (e.g. Intent to Graduate,  Sequence Sheet etc.) of the university?</li>
        <li class="questions">How was your experience getting important resources from USC?</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="small__headings">The Main Insight</p>
    <h2 class="big__headings competition_heading">None of the previous apps were isolated enough to work due to the constant flow of content from other areas.</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">Based on the thrends in our affinity map. We notice that students don't want to exert energy to look for USC content while also getting distracted by more entertaining content.</p>

    <p class="small__headings">Design</p>
    <h2 class="big__headings design__heading">Setbacks + a new direction</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">At first we thought of a website but due to the data we collected majority of students do not visit the school website for information or knew they could get documents from the school website. 
        We stuck to the theme that the phone is the most accessible so we would make an app.</p>

    <p class="small__headings">Testing + Inprovements</p>
    <h2 class="big__headings design__heading">3 major improvements in our design</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbox">Based on various feedback from the other groups, students and lecturers, We continously inproved the design.Here are 3 major improvements</p>

    <p class="small__headings">Conclusion + lessons learned</p>
    <h2 class="big__heading design__heading">What I'd do differently next time.</h2>
    <p class="regular__textbook">This was my first ever UI/UX Project and it was done as part of the Software Engineering Group Project Course.
        I am extremely greatful for this experience and here is a quick note on what I have learnt.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="reflections">Copy to learn.<span class="the__rest">I spent most of my time trying to be orginal in my design. This left less time to finish the rest of my screens.
            Duplicating work and adding your own touch decreases time took to create screens and come wioth the benefit of learning ux that works for millions of users all over the world. 
        </span></li>
        <li class="reflections">Being Insightful and not process driven <span class="the__rest">During this process I collected great amount of information and found myself asking "What is the bigger picture?"
            I believe story telling really helps you reach the end goal of your project.
        </span></li>
        <li class="reflections">Do it Over and Over Again. <span class="the__rest">I made the same screen over and over causing frastration and displeasure. 
            I have learnt that changing your mindset really helps with your mood and progression of work. Instead of seeeing the creation as work I saw it as a invigorating challenge that I would be able to conquer!</span></li>
